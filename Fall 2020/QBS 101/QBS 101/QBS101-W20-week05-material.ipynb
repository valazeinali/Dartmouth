    "## Boolean\n",
    "Booleans as represented as `bool` type in python and store either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "The capitalisation is important here: `True` is a `Boolean` value, while `TRUE` and `true` are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, `True` is also not the same thing as the string `\"True\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are just like any other values in Python. We can assign them to variables, and we can put Booleans in tuples and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, maybe we want to store information about some movies in a user's watch list. We can use a tuple to represent each movie, and we can use a Boolean to represent whether or not this movie has been seen by this user:\n",
    "```\n",
    "movies = [\n",
    "\t(\"Inside Out\", 2015, True),\n",
    "\t(\"Toy Story 4\", 2019, False),\n",
    "\t(\"Up\", 2009, True)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example above, the movies list contains three movies. Of these three movies, the user has seen Inside Out and Up, but not Toy Story 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also print Boolean values, and the output is just `True` or `False` as appropriate.\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(True)   # True\n",
    "print(False)  # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Truth values\n",
    "Every value in Python has some associated _truth value_. It's not particularly intuitive that `\"Hello\"` is somehow associated with either `True` or `False`, but this can be useful, ie. when we use the value as a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the truth value of any value in Python by passing that value to the `bool` function. `bool` will return `True` or `False` depending on the truth value of what we passed in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Values for which `bool` returns `True` are often called _truthy values_, while values for which `bool` returns `False` are often called _falsy_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(bool(\"Hello\"))  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bool(0))              # False\n",
    "print(bool(6))              # True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bool(\"Caterpillar\"))  # True\n",
    "print(bool(\"\"))             # False\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bool([]))             # False\n",
    "print(bool([0, 1, 2, 3]))   # True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bool(True))           # True\n",
    "print(bool(False))          # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a small number of values in Python are falsy, which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any numeric representation of zero. This includes the integer 0, the float 0.0, and representations of zero in other numeric types.\n",
    "The values False and None. We haven't looked at None - yet, but None represents the intentional absence of a value.\n",
    "- Empty sequences and other collections. This includes empty strings, empty tuples, empty lists, and several types we haven't covered at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these values, everything else in Python is _truthy_."
