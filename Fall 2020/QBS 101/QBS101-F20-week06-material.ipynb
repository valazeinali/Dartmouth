    "The loop definition starts with the `for` keyword. This keyword is what tells Python that we want to define a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly after this comes a new variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the `in` keyword, followed by the `iterable` containing the values/items to loop over. This whole line is capped off with a **colon**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the colon comes the (indented) block of code to run for each item in the iterable. Just like with conditional statements, this indentation is important, as it indicates what code is associated with the `for` loop. This indented block is sometimes referred to as the **body of the loop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *new variable* we define as part of the loop is going to allow refering to a given element in our iterable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop runs as follows:\n",
    "1. if the iterable yiels nothing:\n",
    "  - the iterable is \"empty\" (eg. empty list) OR \n",
    "  - the last item has been yielded \n",
    "\n",
    "  then the loop is excited and the body is skipped;\n",
    "2. otherwise, the iterable object yields the next element it contains (eg. next element in the list). That item is assigned to the _new variable_ name defined after the keyword `for`;\n",
    "3. the body of the loop is exectued (all indented commands)\n",
    "4. go back to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"movies\" example, during the first iteration (cycle) of the loop, the first item from the `movies` list, which is this tuple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(\n",
    "\t\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\",\n",
    "\t\"Michel Gondry\",\n",
    "\t2004\n",
    ")\n",

    "This tuple is assigned to `movie` (singular!), and then the code in the loop body is run. \n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f\"{movie[0]} ({movie[2]}), by {movie[1]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using the `movie` variable, which is assigned  the first tuple in the `movies` list (ie. `movie = movies[0]`). So on this first iteration of the loop, `movie[0]` (ie. `movies[0][0]`) is the string, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"; `movie[1]` (ie. `movies[0][1]`) is the string, \"Michel Gondry\"; and `movie[2]` (ie. `movies[0][2]`) is the integer: 2004.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the loop body is executed in its entirety, the iterable *tries* to assign the next item to the `movie` variable. Since we still have movies in the list, Python gives us the next tuple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(\n",

    "This happens again and again until all items in `movies` were assigned to `movie` one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to keep in mind is that the name, `movie`, is *not important* from a functionality perspective. Python isn't making the connection between the names `movie` and `movies`. Therefore, any variable name would work the same way:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for m in movies:\n",
    "\tprint(f\"{m[0]} ({m[2]}), by {m[1]}\")\n",

    "\tprint(f\"{movie_details[0]} ({movie_details[2]}), by {movie_details[1]}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is good practice to make sure the variable name accurately describethe data it will contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, each tuple represents information about a single movie, so a name like `movie` is very appropriate and descriptive. A name like `x` would work equally well but would not be as descriptive, and it can make the code harder to reason about, especially in more complex loops."

    "\n",
    "Dictionary comprehension is a technique for transforming one dictionary into another dictionary. During this transformation, items within the original dictionary can be conditionally included in the new dictionary and each item can be transformed as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to do dictionary comprehension in Python is to be able to access the `key` objects and the `value` objects of a `dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n",
    "# Put all keys of `dict1` in a list and returns the list\n",
    "dict1.keys()\n",
    "dict_keys(['c', 'd', 'a', 'b'])\n",
    "# Put all values saved in `dict1` in a list and returns the list\n",
    "dict1.values()\n",
    "dict_values([3, 4, 1, 2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, one can access each `key-value` pair within a dictionary using the `items()` method:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dict1.items()\n",
    "dict_items([('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('a', 1), ('b', 2)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The general template to follow for dictionary comprehension. Note that dictionary comprehension uses curly braces `{}`, rather than `[]` in other collections:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dict_variable = {key:value for (key,value) in dictonary.items()}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Simple dictionary comprehension:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}\n",
    "# Double each value in the dictionary\n",
    "double_dict1 = {k:v*2 for (k,v) in dict1.items()}\n",
    "print(double_dict1)\n",
    "{'e': 10, 'a': 2, 'c': 6, 'b': 4, 'd': 8}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the comprehension code above, a new dictionary `double_dict1` is created from a dictionary `dict1` by  doubling each `value` in it and leaving the keys intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the key values can also be modified in a dictionary comprehension. For example, one can create the same dictionary as above but also change the names of the key.\n",
    "```\n",
    "dict1_keys = {k*2:v for (k,v) in dict1.items()}\n",
    "print(dict1_keys)\n",
    "{'dd': 4, 'ee': 5, 'aa': 1, 'bb': 2, 'cc': 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This only works because we are creating a new dictionary, as dictionaries keys are immutable.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `else` clause in the context of loops is not as intuitive as it is with an `if` statement. It is worth thinking about `else` as a \"no break\" clause when we use it with loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `else` clause attached to a loop **will only run** if a **no break statement** was encountered during the execution of that loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's a loop to determine whether or not a number is prime. A prime number is a number divisible only by itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can determine whether or not something is prime is by dividing it by every number which comes before it. If none of these divisions produce an integer result, the number is prime.\n",

    "\n",
    "If a `break` is encountered, the number is not prime. Therefore, if the loop is completed (ie. no `break` is encountered)the number is prime. These are also the **conditions for triggering an `else` clause*** in the loop.\n",

    "# Get a number to test from the user\n",
